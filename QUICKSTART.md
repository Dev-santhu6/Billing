# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

1. **Start a local web server** (choose one method):
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

2. **Open in browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Start using**:
   - Add products in the "Products" section
   - Create bills in the "Billing" section
   - Track finances in the "Dashboard" section

## First Time Setup

1. Add some sample products:
   - Click "Add New Product"
   - Fill in product details (barcode, name, prices, etc.)
   - Save

2. Create your first bill:
   - Go to "Billing" section
   - Search for a product or scan barcode
   - Add to cart and complete the bill

3. View your dashboard:
   - Go to "Dashboard" section
   - See income, expenses, and profit

## Tips

- **Barcode Scanning**: Works best on mobile devices or with a webcam
- **Data Storage**: All data is stored locally in your browser
- **Export/Import**: Use CSV export to backup your products
- **Print Invoice**: Use browser's print function (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P)

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera not working?** Grant camera permissions in browser settings
- **Data lost?** Check browser storage settings
- **Scanner not working?** Try manual barcode entry as fallback
